# Lightning-Capture-for-Camera
Build a cheap device for your camera, to automatically photograph lightning as it happens
Based on Arduino (but using a faster ESP32 processor, this clever device allows your camera to wait in standby, watching for lightning and take a photo the instant it happens.

A dslr or mirrorless camera with a cable release socket will be required.

Using a battery powered processor, complete with built in-charger and off-the-shelf modules, the device can be quickly and easily built.

A little soldering skill is required, as is a bit of computer skill to load the firmware onto the device, but there are how-to guides for each step and a user forum on Photrio.

Now the caveat. The device has been built & tested and it works great indoors. However there has yet to be thunderstorm to test it in the real world. As soon as a suitable storm blows through, I will be running outsideto fully test the device.

This is a new project, so documentation and the code will appear over the coming weeks. There is enough here to get started and order the parts. Much of the documentaion will be the same as in my other projects, downloading and installing the firmware, for example, so take a look at my other projects to see what is involved.
