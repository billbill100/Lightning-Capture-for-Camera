# Lightning-Capture-for-Camera
Build a cheap device for your camera, to automatically photograph lightning as it happens
Based on Arduino (but using a faster ESP32 processor, this clever device allows your camera to wait in standby, watching for lightning and take a photo the instant it happens.

A dslr or mirrorless camera with a cable release socket will be required.

Using a battery powered processor, complete with built in-charger and off-the-shelf modules, the device can be quickly and easily built.

A little soldering skill is required, as is a bit of computer skill to load the firmware onto the device, but there are how-to guides for each step and a user forum on Photrio.

There are two versions that can be built.
The full version includes an Oled display, with parameters that can be changed.
A basic model, with minimam components, that just works using the default parameters.

Now the caveat. The device has been built & tested and it works great indoors. However there has yet to be thunderstorm to test it in the real world. As soon as a suitable storm blows through, I will be running outsideto fully test the device.

This is a new project, so documentation may change over the coming weeks.
